- Could you do me a favour and please give me an hypothesis:

During "Nudge: Influencing Behaviour" I was so impressed by the dedactic and pedagogic level that it bleaked my experience of other courses. 
I was impressed by the high  pedagogic and dedactic level of the "Nudge: Influencing Behaviour" course. So much so that it bleaked performances of my other lecturers. Lets dive into the best practices deployed throughout the course

## Context - what is nudgeing
Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory#Definition">following</a>:
<cite>
"A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not".</cite>
