Introduction to the DTS portfolio assignment
<!--excerpt -->

<br>

To reflect and order thoughts concerning the themes of digitalization and sustainability throughout the curriculum, students were asked to deliver a short write-up concerning these themes for each of the followed courses in the master. 

## Official requirements:

- Reflection of at least 300 words *on each course* that is followed by a student
- Reflection section concerning the master thesis project
- Think out of the box, be creative


## Probing questions

- [Probing Questions.xlsx]({{ "assets/dts/Probing Questions.xlsx" | relative_url }}) / <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XTrINVtwatpxhZITsJLs-Va559pbC-BhX6Oak15eCgk/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0">google sheet</a>
- To what extent did you reach the objectives of this course? (see course manuals!)  

<br>
Unfortunately, this is going to be quite a pain:
